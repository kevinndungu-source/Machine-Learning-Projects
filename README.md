# Machine Learning Code
Welcome to my Machine Learning (ML) repository! This repository contains a collection of code files that demonstrate various tasks involved in the ML workflow, starting from fetching data from scikit-learn datasets to performing data loading, cleaning, filling missing data, feature engineering, and more. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics of ML or an experienced practitioner exploring new techniques, these code files provide hands-on examples to guide you through the process. Feel free to explore, experiment, and enhance your ML skills with this resource!
